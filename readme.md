## Powershell Markov text

This started as a desire to generate my own Lorem Ipsum text. Googling for tools,
and one link led to another, and eventually I wanted to make my own Powershell
implementation of a Markov chain text generator based on
[Shabda Raaj's article and Python script](http://agiliq.com/blog/2009/06/generating-pseudo-random-text-with-markov-chains-u/).

I saw no need to load the entire text file into memory at once, so it uses pipeline
streams and queues to avoid loading all the text in at once. Of course the Markov
chain variable is in-memory and gets big, but *c'est la vie*.

It's a little rough as-is; I'm commenting and uncommenting parts and hitting F5 in ISE. But it's working and funny right now, so I thought I'd share it now.

Some sample output. The input text is [My Man Jeves](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/8164) by Wodehouse from Project Gutenberg.
